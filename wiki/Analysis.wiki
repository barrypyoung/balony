#summary Analysis of screens with Baony.

This is the analysis module:

The "Load Data..." button is used to load saved data from the [Scoring] module. One or more tab-delimited text files are imported and the collated data is displayed in a data table.

Alternatively, a previous analysis session can be restored using the "Restore Table..." button. This loads files with a ".bdt" suffix and in addition to the scored data, it also includes information such as gene linkage, cut-off values and excluded genes. Compared to repeatedly loading the scored data, it saves time as these parameters do not need to be set each time.

The "Default Table Settings" panel contains a list of default values for parameters used to analyse each screen.

After loading screen data, a data table will be displayed showing information for each position in the array:

The "Screen Info" panel provides some basic information on the data being displayed.

The "Filtering" panel is used to set-up [Linkage] information and has an option to hide or display genes that are to be excluded from the analysis.
