The linkage window is displayed from the data table, by typing in the name of a gene and clicking the "Linkage" button. This will pop up the following window:

The vertical bars indicate the average size of colonies flanking the query gene (in blue). In an SGA experiment, these colonies will generally by smaller than expected due to the low frequency of recombination. The black line indicates a moving average across a number of genes as shown by the "Smoothing" value.

The two sliders can be used to specify a range of genes that will be excluded from the analysis. Simply move these sliders into the appropriate positions and click "Apply". The number of genes shown can be changed by altering the value in the "Window size" box.
